# World_Happiness_Index
World Happiness Report with its affecting factors
This project is equipped with a fascinating story of what makes a nation 'the happiest', like the current number one "Finland". Well, several factors have been identified to alter the happiness of people in a nation.
Like they say happiness is a choice, this project supports the statement helps you understand better the WHY. I have used Tableau and Tableau prep-builder for data modelling and visualization, it includes some cool 
animations, interactive dashbaords and most of all some mind bending factors which seem to be responsible for the varying happiness index over the years ranging from 2015-2022, MS Excel has been used for data cleaning and transformation. I hope you find the right reasons for your happiness and my analysis will help you avoid the factors pulling it down.
